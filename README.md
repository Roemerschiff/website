# website
Source code for the Roemerschiff website.

This repository holds the sources for the Romerschiff website. The website is served from the Roemerschiff.githib.io repository,
but that can only contain static code. Some of the pages are generated using scripts and those scripts and the other sources live here.
So, the workflow is:
- Do changes here
- run make script
- check the result looks good
- copy to local copy of Roemerschiff.github.io
- push
